# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer

This project is an interactive web application designed to help users visualize and understand various data structures and algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring concepts such as arrays, linked lists, and more.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations of common data structures
- Step-by-step walkthroughs of algorithmic operations
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Implemented Data Structures

Currently, the following data structures are implemented:

1. **Arrays**: Visualize basic array operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
2. **Linked Lists**: Explore singly linked lists with operations like insertion at the beginning, end, or a specific position, and deletion by value.
